# All code and design files for the Fifth Element badge will be here after Defcon 27

# Badge Usage
The badge has 2 modes: Bling and Movie. Change modes by pressing the mode button on the back.
Bling mode simply flashes the LEDs.
Movie mode only lights up when you get all 4 stones placed in the correct positions on the badge.

##Stone Retention Strings
We included 4 strings with the badges. These are for tying to the stones so that they can be attached to the badge and not get lost. The stones are heavy and have a tendancy to fall off the badge when worn.

To use the strings, tie them in a loop through the hole in the bottom of the stone. Feed that loop through the small holes in the badge near each stone connector. Then connect the string to the lanyard clip behind the badge. There are two different lengths of string. This is because two of the stones are closer to the lanyard holes. Make sure to put the strings on the correct stones based on their position.

If you mix up the resistors after you've removed them from the packages, you can identify them by the numbers printed on them:
10 - 100
51 - 510
2k - 202
3.9k - 3901
6.2k - 622
8.2k - 822
